- 👋 Hi, I’m @martensms
- 👀 I’m interested in coding with v8 and node.js!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to cross-compile to other (embedded and mobile) platforms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making the Web a better place for everyone.
- 🖥️ My professional work requires me to write Zend/Magento based Enterprise PHP applications.
- 🕮 I have a lot of experience in SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs, Magento 1 & 2, Node.js, Express, Koa, and Zend.
- 🔨 I'm currently working on a node.js based wiki, hopefully it will allow to share development knowledge for the semantic Web.
- 🪟 I'm still using Windows 7 on my old Thinkpad laptop, because I really do hate Windows 10 and 11.
